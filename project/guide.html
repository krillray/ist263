        <h2>How to Build Your Own PC</h2>
        
        <p>
            Building your own PC might seem overwhelming, but it's fun and rewarding. 
            Whether you're building for gaming, school, or general use, 
            understanding the parts and the process is key. Here's how to do it:

            <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check Compatibility first</strong> – Ensure all components work together or you might run into issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Track of Screws</strong> – Use a small bowl or magnetic mat to organize all screws and standoffs during your build.</li>
                <li><strong>Ground Yourself</strong> – Always ground yourself before touching components—especially the CPU and Motherboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Cable Management Matters</strong> – Organize your cables for better airflow and cooling.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Force Anything</strong> – If a part doesn't fit easily, double-check orientation or compatibility—never push or bend it!</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Step 1 - Pick Your Parts</h2>
        
        <section>
            <h3>these are the components you'll need:</h3>
            
            <dl>
                <dt>CPU (Processor)</dt>
                <dd>- The brains</dd>
                
                <dt>Motherboard</dt>
                <dd>- The central hub where everything communicates</dd>

                <dt>RAM (Memory)</dt>
                <dd>- Temporary memory that helps with multitasking</dd>
                
                <dt>Storage (SSD/HDD)</dt>
                <dd>- Where your files and program are stored</dd>
                
                <dt>GPU (Graphics Card)</dt>
                <dd>- The eyes, displays what is currently on</dd>
                
                <dt>Power Supply (PSU)</dt>
                <dd>- Provides power to everything</dd>
                
                <dt>Case</dt>
                <dd>- Holds everything together</dd>
                
                <dt>Operating System (like windows or linux)</dt>
                <dd>- The software that runs everything</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>Step 2 - Prepare Your Workspace</h3>
            <p>
                Set up a clean, static-free space. Make sure you ground yourself by 
                touching metal, like the computer case, before handling sensitive parts to 
                avoid damaging them with static electricity.

            <h3>Step 3 - Assemble the PC</h3>
            <p>Here is a basic overview of the building process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Install the CPU onto the motherboard.</li>
                <li>Attach the CPU cooler on top of the CPU. Not too much though, you only need it to be around the size of a pea.</li>
                <li>Pull the lever down until the CPU is secure in.</li>
                <li>Unlock the metal tabs for the RAM slots.</li>
                <li>Place the motherboard inside the case.</li>
                <li>Install the internal power supply in the case.</li>
                <li>Install the storage drives.</li>
                <li>Install your GPU.</li>
                <li>Connect all the power and data cables, then double check connections.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Step 4: First Boot and BIOS setup</h3>
            <p>
                Turn on the PC for the first time. If it doesn't power on, check your 
                connections. Navigate to the **BIOS** setup (usually by pressing DEL or F2 
                during startup) and make sure all parts are detected.

            <h3>Step 5 - Install the Operating System</h3>
            <p>
                Plug in a USB with windows or another OS and follow the installation instructions. 
                Afterward, install drivers and recommended programs. 
                Congratulations—you've built your first PC!
